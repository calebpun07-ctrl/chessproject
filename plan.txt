uuhhhh
START OF PROJECT IDK TEH DATE LIKE 7-30-24------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
have a board
the board gets edited because its an array

each thing can be demited in the array

i think i should  it in the text box or whatever

order of turns
-pickpeice
-pick 

mss jl
until valid move played, repaet move function

(the list level will have, in order, y cord of starting, x cord of start, peice piece, y cord of final, x cord of final)

pickpeice returns the location of the pickpeice
    
    needs location and turn
pickmove returns where the peice should go 

    needs location of OG peice and place itll move
movemove would move said peice to place
movemove never go tused and now pickmove is teh most impoatrant

should make it so that if only one move possible (mainly pawn) it auto make sthat move

once this one is done, make a simple version without all the checks

ok plane for checkmate

king cords, 
Func - run though each avaible postion fo king
if true = checkmate

OK FUTRUE CALEB WE HAVE A PROBELM:
THAT NEW FUNCTION YOU WROET TO SAVE TIME IS MISSSING TWO THINGS, CLEAR OPEN MVOES
AND ADDING the CAPTURED MOVES TO THE THING AFTER CLEARING AND DHOWING OPEN MOVESTHIS IS WHAT UOU GET WHEN YOU START WITH pawn

SOLUTION: ADD THE SHOW USER MOVES IN AND ADD IN TEH CATURES LIST, SHOUKLD BE ESASY FIX FOR YOU

GOOD LUCK LOSER I HATE YOU 

dude its 8/19/24 and i have no idea what he is talking about
what

star log 2024

ok wokring on chekmat 
Its gonna replace all the spots where king is with like O or somthing
then if a peice can take it it will and put one of it there, maybe switch up teh order
so that it will take the inside on firts so it doe snot block things. or just go with it
screw it we ball
idk how im gonna test other peices moves.

i hate pawns

ok checkmate is being a 
anyways
ima just make a second main folder
and that one will just be chess bu you can captre the king

ok im back still have not done anything for chekcmate but now we have AI BABYYYYY
its still almost comepletly random. if the randomly slected peice can 
capture a peice it will, but that still really rare


OK NEED TO ADD TO CODE SO THAT YOU CANT CAPTURE UR OWN PEIACES.
ok i think i did that

i think

9/21/2024 help ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

9/22/2024 we at 3553 total lines ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ok ideas for optimizing bishop:
- i could put all the move values into a list of four and edit each of thos indivaly, then reste each on after 

9/26/2024 we at 5k lines counting all the chess AI stuff ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

10/1/2024 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

log date 7th of 10th month 2024 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I think I could do checkmate by combing the AI (to run through every sing possible move) 
and check (to check if there is a move taht prevents check)

BUT taht seems really hard

update on the 7th: spent whole day optimizing rook and bishop it aviod doing chekmate to aviod doing work, saved over 600 lines of code: now at 4404 lines

finshed adding optimization to almost everything (everything in functions, most of teh AI i think)
now at 4127
just to play chess its 1340 lines
did some more editing, added the new rook and bishop code, no wat 3545
the chessAI has al hte new code, varbles is going exitct, only one left in functions, only 10 left in whole folde

stit i coudhl add
 - could set up ankin smartypants so that when given option to captur eteh queen it does so
 -on that point it could be so that each peice has its points value and it woudl captur eteh higehts p[pint value peice it could]
peepee pooopoe

guess who is a genius. yep
its me 
caleb li an pun
i have made chess (or at least have all the componetes to make chess)
and it works at a 32% success rate.
take that jeff bezos amazon dont got nothing on me.
total lines: 3275
to play a fully working game of chess, 1669 lines
took me 3 months 

08/29/25 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
i have no idea what the heck this progarm does man im so confused
i would have to spend like a a week reminding myself and relarning how 
all this works


09/02/25 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
things to do now that i have learned what colors are:
    print("\033[2J\033[H", end="")
this thingy above me will essenitally clear console after a print

i could also add colors for the board. i shoudlnt be too hard. i woudl just need to go to 
showboard() or whtever its called and have a list of dark spaces and ligth spaces so that 
i can differnetact and then i can use teh full block acII charaters

9/3/25 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OK finally added code that will make the board different colors

9/4/25 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SILKSONG TODAY ITS BEEN 100 YEARS

9//11/25 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ok 9/11 note unfortnate timing on that one
lots of stuffs happened
anywayss i plan to stream the code itself for fixing chess better AI.py on liek monday or tuesday

9/16/25 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

have been adding proper documentation for all functions starting at teh functions . py 
and have discovered that the chekchek and chekchek2 functions ar eteh same but one
shows the board and one doesnt. so im setting a defualt varibel in teh first on so that 
its defults shows it, but if false it does not.

ok i removed chekchek2 but im keeping teh function for a bit incase i notice any problems

10/6/25 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

removing chekchek2

10/7/25 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OK many things have happened. I removed a LOT (almost all) of the 
repetive code in pickmove with return_user_move. very useful
also removed clearopenmove and integreated it into showopenmove. 
removed fillspotNS and mvoed it into fillspot. Also updated the readme and
made some stuff move effectent.

10/8/25 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ok so IDEA: can make queen, bischop and rook code in functions all in one loop, and all that matters is
the directions list, and whether or not 

10/9/25 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have impeletnted that in functions now, have cut the lines in that file down to 660. 
works: coudl also do somethign similar with pawn and kinght but im too lazy to do that
also have made it so that when it is showing the user what moves they want to make it 
shows the peices that are captureable in red. nifty little thing

10/16/25 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

have removed castling code in in the king, and now plan
to change up how it works. I will have new thign that keeps track 
of all teh moves that are made in teh whole game, thats how i will do
castle and en passant and whatnot. probally with ave to do in the simplestuff file

10/17/25 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

make console to input commands for main.py where i can run them directly

10/18/25 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

finished making teh castleing code, works much better, now 
am ready to combine knight, pawn and king, start 615, see if we cut that down

ok completed: now at 591, and did teh same for pickmove king and got us down 
too 572 lines

10/19/25 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ok i think i just need to completely redo all of checkmate
