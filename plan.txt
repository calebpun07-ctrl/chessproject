uuhhhh
START OF PROJECT IDK TEH DATE LIKE 7-30-24------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
have a board
teh board gets edited because its an array

each thing can be demited in teh array

i think i should  it in teh text box or whatever

order of turns
-pickpeice
-pick 

mss jl
until valid move played, repaet move function


(the list level will have, in order, y cord of starting, x cord of start, peice piece, y cord of final, x cord of final)

pickpeice returns the location of the pickpeice
    
    needs location and turn
pickmove returns where the peice should go 

    needs location of OG peice and place itll move
movemove would move said peice to place
movemove never go tused and now pickmove is teh most impoatrant

should make it so that if only one move possible (mainly pawn) it auto make sthat move

once this one is done, make a simple version without all the checks


ok plane for checkmate

king cords, 
Func - run though each avaible postion fo king
if true = checkmate

OK FUTRUE CALEB WE HAVE A PROBELM:
THAT NEW FUNCTION YOU WROET TO SAVE TIME IS MISSSING TWO THINGS, CLEAR OPEN MVOES
AND ADDING TEH CAPTURED MOVES TO THE THING AFTER CLEARING AND DHOWING OPEN MOVESTHIS IS WHAT UOU GET WHEN YOU START WITH pawn

SOLUTION: ADD THE SHOW USER MOVES IN AND ADD IN TEH CATURES LIST, SHOUKLD BE ESASY FIX FOR YOU

GOOD LUCK LOSER I HATE YOU 

dude its 8/19/24 and i have no idea what he is talking about
what

star log 2024

ok wokring on chekmat 
Its gonna replace all teh spots where king is with like O or somthing
then if a peice can take it it will and put one of it tehre, maybe switch up teh order
so that it will take teh inside on firts so it doe snot block things. or just go with it
screw it we ball
idk how im gonna test other peices moves.

i hate pawns

ok checkmate is being a 
anyways
ima just make a second main folder
and that one will just be chess bu you can captre the king

ok im back still have not done anything for chekcmate but now we have AI BABYYYYY
its still almost comepletly random. if the randomly slected peice can 
capture a peice it will, but that still really rare


OK NEED TO ADD TO CODE SO THAT YOU CANT CAPTURE UR OWN PEIACES.
ok i think i did that

i think

9/21/2024 help ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

9/22/2024 we at 3553 total lines ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ok ideas for optimizing bishop:
- i could put all teh move values into a list of four and edit each of thos indivaly, then reste each on after 

9/26/2024 we at 5k lines counting all the chess AI stuff ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

10/1/2024 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

log date 7th of 10th month 2024 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I think I could do checkmate by combing the AI (to run through every sing possible move) 
and check (to check if there is a move taht prevents check)

BUT taht seems really hard

update on the 7th: spent whole day optimizing rook and bishop it aviod doing chekmate to aviod doing work, saved over 600 lines of code: now at 4404 lines

finshed adding optimization to almost everything (everything in functions, most of teh AI i think)
now at 4127
just to play chess its 1340 lines
did some more editing, added the new rook and bishop code, no wat 3545
the chessAI has al hte new code, varbles is going exitct, only one left in functions, only 10 left in whole folde

stit i coudhl add
 - could set up ankin smartypants so that when given option to captur eteh queen it does so
 -on that point it could be so that each peice has its points value and it woudl captur eteh higehts p[pint value peice it could]
peepee pooopoe

guess who is a genius. yep
its me 
caleb li an pun
i have made chess (or at least have all the componetes to make chess)
and it works at a 32% success rate.
take that jeff bezos amazon dont got nothing on me.
total lines: 3275
to play a fully working game of chess, 1669 lines
took me 3 months

i have no idea what the heck this progarm does man im so confused
i would have to spend like a a week reminding myself and relarning how 
all this works


09/02/25 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
things to do not that i have learned what colors are:
    print("\033[2J\033[H", end="")
this thingy above me will essenitally clear console after a print

i could also add colors for the board. i shoudlnt be too hard. i woudl just need to go to 
showboard() or whtever its called and have a list of dark spaces and ligth spaces so that 
i can differnetact and then i can use teh full block acII charaters

9/3/25 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OK finally added code that will make the board different colors
