This project was started on a roadtrip across washinton state with no serice in the back of a RV. It is bad
the rest of this TXT file is lots of rambling and yapping so this is an attempt to be more proffesional.
TXT FILES:
  -intro(readfirst).txt
    you are reading it
  -plan.txt
    short history of my progress and goals of the project over past 2 years
  -simulation.txt
    holds different code for similations for testing
  -ERROR_to_fix.txt 
    differnet errors that need fixing
  -oldNightandKing.txt
    old code, outdated
  -archive.txt
    archive of old, outdated code, that is ineffecint or bad

PY FILES
 -main.py
  runner file, all commands run from here
 -functions.py
  MOST basic functions exist in this file, eg, building blocks are here
 -simplestuff.py
  begins to combine functions from teh functions.py file into runable code
 -chessAI.py
  basic bot. its not ai its random
 -chessBetterAI.py
  slightly better bot.
 -checkmate.py
  holds checkmate code.
 -textfilebeasueimdumb.py
  file that i used to test bits of code (liek when you forget what len() does)

the coconut file is there because those who know

commenting on this file is spotty, its few adn far between often

proffesionalism ending now

ok
so
you wanted to learn how this works
well it sucks so get ready

The board is composed of a 2d array. long story short, its a cordinate system
Whenever a cordinate is mentioned in the text editor, it SHOULD be the one based on the visual system
excamle: the X would be located at 4,4
1 ▞ ▞ ▞ ▞ ▞ ▞ ▞ ▞
2 ▞ ▞ ▞ ▞ ▞ ▞ ▞ ▞
3 ▞ ▞ ▞   ▞ ▞ ▞ ▞
4 ▞ ▞ ▞ ▞ ▞ ▞ ▞ ▞
5 ▞ ▞ X ▞ ▞ ▞ ▞ ▞         #ok so it no longer looks like this, i orginally
6 ▞ ▞ ▞ ▞ ▞ ▞ ▞ ▞         had it like this with ▞ as teh tiles, but now it is alternating 
7 ▞ ▞ ▞ ▞ ▞ ▞ ▞ ▞         black and white spaces
8 ▞ ▞ ▞ ▞ ▞ ▞ ▞ ▞
  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

however, in teh code, teh X would be located at 3,3 because the genius who made coding was like
"we should make all list start with 0"
so be wary of that
some functions (I think most of them) take the Real set of cords, like 0,0 to 7,7
however some dont
fillSpotNS takes fake cords, as well as fillSpot

realcords:
    clearSpot
    checkSpaceClear
    checkPieceBlackSymbol
    checkPieceWhiteSymbol
    checkPieceSymbol
    checkPiece

uuhhhh
what else

oh i used the theme "Tommorow Night Blue" in vscode so
like
use that beacuse tommorwo niht blue is the best

▞ < this represents a empty space. if you find a better represntive of a blank space that would be great.

or that or think that I should spent time coding it so that it alternates (i wont) please tell me

checkmate folder notes
  showmoveking will make a list of the possible places that the king could move

the txt file for oldNIghtand King saved so much time because i optmized some stuff but then it brokee so it
is smart to save stuff if you wanna change it so that you dont lose ton of stuff

ok well you can see that night is the same because i used a list to index each move and what notes
and i thought that i could od that for the kign as wel becaus elike you know its pretty simialr
that didnt work but if you can make it work that you go ahead and do it ( i think you could its just hard to do with the rook and castleing, see the kings moves in pickmoveKing)

another place for optmatzin gis the bishop and rook you could (update 10/7/24, they were optmized, saved over 300+ lines of code)

uh in the pickmoveking function there are a bunch of wanrings becaus ei acdeintly did a bunch fo work in it 
for pickmove and that was bad so that why teh wanrings ar ethere to warn anyone taht does that

ok this is important:

playlist for this (these are the only songs that youc an listen too if you work on this)
(the code will break fi you dont)

- dreamers ball by queen (classic coding song also its banger)
- funky galeio by sure sure (chill banger check it out)
- computer talkk by austenyo (its song bout computer adn ur using a comuter to comute to work or somth idk)
- mr blue sky ,elo (cuz when code no work the blue skies will come adn you have to use tommoronw night blue becuase its the best so it makes sense)
- the tide by INOHA  [idk why] [you gotta wait till half way trust me]
- rises the moon by liana flor i think
- basicly the whole apricot princess album

ok more stuff for AI!

the value brick is returning is in the format of :[7, 1, '♞', 6, 1]
- 7 and 1 are the real cords of teh starting point of the peice 
- then the peice 
- then 6 adn 1 are the spots it moves to on the board you see, so teh fakce cords 

ok since the AI's are sentient, theuy must have names:

  AImakemoveWhite birth name is: T-Rex Orange Justice
  AImakemoveBlack given name is: George W. Bush, identifes as jennifer sanchez
  AdvancedAImakemoveBlack first name: Zane, last name: From Ninjago
  AdvancedAImakemoveWhite1 birth name is: Useless
  AdvancedAImakemoveWhite offical name is: Anakin Smartypants

ok im too lazy to figure out how things work. I dont really know how check really works anyore
so
wait i dont even think the chekcmate file is ever even used?

whoa this lokos cool
▞▞▞▞▞▞▞▞▞▞
▞▞▞▞▞▞▞▞▞▞▞▞▞▞▞▞▞▞▞▞▞▞▞▞▞▞▞▞▞▞▞▞▞▞▞▞▞▞▞▞▞▞▞▞▞▞▞▞▞▞▞▞▞▞▞▞▞▞

oh yeah the archive.txt folder. That has a bunch of old code I wanted to save. 
Its liek a better vreison that the oldknight and king folder. 
use that one and see teh rules for staonge at the bottom of the -

checkmate takes one of the "ai" programs and just runs though all of that and gets all teh moves
chekcs each one to see if it gets you out of check and then WILL return a list of the possible moves 
and wait until the user makes that move

dude i dont remeber ANYTHING - 08/29/25
