This project was started on a roadtrip across washinton state with no serice in the back of a RV. It is bad.<br>
All the code is meant to run in the terminal and there is is no GUI. All the peices are ASCII type things.<br>

VARIBLE NAMES:

Many varible names are completely nonsensical and have no meaning at all (Some I asked my girlfreind to name). I am very afriad to make any mass changes to varibles for fear of breaking the code. Apolgizes.

commenting on this file is spotty, its few adn far between often. A LOT OF SPAGETTI CODE
LIKE MORE THAN IN A ITALLIAN RESTURANT IN THE MIDDLE OF VENICE
