It is blacks turn rn. We would like to make this move:[1, 3, '♔', 3, 5]
black wanted to make this move but it resulted in check
[1, 3, '♔', 3, 5]

black king is in check from that pawn, but it can take said pawn, however for some reson that results in check.

ok so im a dumabs the bishop is there teh problem we ned to fick is just in the pickmoveblackai function and just ad a thing for getting teh kind out of sitiations. its already don in the white one.


big test message

and movemove2advanceai might be the problem for black

make it so taht if they picka. peice that has no moves it does not allow

remove the code and turn into a function from picmove that gets the input from the user and returns eitehr the move or false

things are broken: checkmate, put queen at 5,5 and and take kings pawn to see error
