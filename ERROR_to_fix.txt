It is blacks turn rn. We would like to make this move:[1, 3, '♔', 3, 5]
black wanted to make this move but it resulted in check
[1, 3, '♔', 3, 5]

black king is in check from that pawn, but it can take said pawn, however for some reson that results in check.

ok so im a dumabs the bishop is there teh problem we ned to fick is just in the pickmoveblackai function and just ad a thing for getting teh kind out of sitiations. its already don in the white one.


big test message

and movemove2advanceai might be the problem for black
